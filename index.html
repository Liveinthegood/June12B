  <H1 class="honor2">ðŸª¶ WHAT IS IT?</H1>


  <h1 class="bodytext"><span class="pro">Native Strength</span> is a centuries-old inter-tribal traditional mental health care system.  It uses <span class="pro">medicine wheels, teaching triangles, and traditional stories </span>to illustrate concepts and provide useful tools for personal insite and coping strategies.</h1>

  <H1 class="honor2">ðŸª¶ HYAPATIA IS THE FOUNDER OF NATIVE STRENGTH</H1>

  <img class="billysilly2" src="images/HL_NativeStrengthPilot.png" alt="Hyapatia Lee picture">



    <h1 class="bodytext">After experiencing a successful traditional ceremony to have a baby, Hyapatia began <span class="pro">studying with two medicine men, a medicine woman (Gladys Tantaquideon, brother to the last chief of the Mohicans), and a Hawaiian Kahuna. </span>These teachers shared traditional wisdom from the Mayan, Lakota, Cherokee, Hawaiian, and many other cultures.</h1> 

    <hr>

    <h1 class="bodytext">In 2001 Hyapatia was elected to the prestigious position of <span class="pro">Blessed Woman for the Lost River band of the Cherokee.</span> Every weekend she taught the people to speak Cherokee, conducted pipe ceremonies and presided over sweat lodges, healing ceremonies. </h1>
      
    <HR>
      
    <h1 class="bodytext">As Hypatia began to teach the many things she had learned from the elders, it became apparent that this information was just as useful to the <span class="pro">members of the Lost River band as it had been to her.</span> She knew sharing this knowledge with the rest of the world would help heal many who were suffering. It would be a crime to withhold knowledge that could help others to live a better life.</h1>
